
* OpenShift setup:
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned
- downloaded archive, extracted to folder in Program Files
- added executables to $PATH
- switched on Hyper-V
- added current user to Hyper-V administrators, log out+log in
- run 'crc setup'
- run 'crc start --nameserver 1.1.1.1', pasted copied 'pull secret'
(for debugging: crc start --log-level debug)
if start failed - need to stop VM from Hyper-V UI and recreate it via crc commands
- after when cluster started, next message will appear:
-------
Started the OpenShift cluster

To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following the instructions returned by executing 'crc oc-env'.
Then you can access your cluster by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'.
To login as a cluster admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p HqC3I-wgtiB-q7qCf-KEsuK https://api.crc.testing:6443'.

You can also run 'crc console' and use the above credentials to access the OpenShift web console.
The console will open in your default browser.
-------
- run next command: @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('crc oc-env') DO @call %i
- after that you could login into cluster as developer or admin
-------
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
-------
- create new project: oc new-project andrei-test-project
-------
Now using project "andrei-test-project" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
-------
- add application to the project: oc new-app rails-postgresql-example
-------
--> Deploying template "openshift/rails-postgresql-example" to project andrei-test-project

     Rails + PostgreSQL (Ephemeral)
     ---------
     An example Rails application with a PostgreSQL database. For more information about using this template, including OpenShift considerations, see https://github.com/sclorg/rails-ex/blob/master/README.md.
-------
- run 'crc stop'
